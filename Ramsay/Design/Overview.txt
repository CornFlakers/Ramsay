Project Ramsay.

For too long, I have been using google note and scrap paper to keep track of recipes.
I tried downloading [a thousand] app(s), it was just messy and cluttered and well ... bad.

I aim to make an app that you can use on any device, mainly mobile, that can house your recipes,
pantry, fridge items. Eggs, flour, salt, potatoes, spinach, milk. 

It will start out managing items in your fridge/pantry. 
The goal is that when you use a bit of something, through a recipe that the app
knows about, the app will subtract that quantity of item from your stock.

Eventually, you will train the app and share with it your recipes and other recipes you find online.
Ultimately you could parse json/xml recipes from other ramsay users or supporting apis into ramsay.
Ramsay will then be able to tell you what recpies you can make based off of your stock.

No more rummaging and wondering what you have left.

Spill a bit? Ramsay will alert you when you are 25%, 10%, 5% and 0% low on something so you have ultimate
time to make a run to the store on your way out or the weekend.

We will target using grams to start out with, as we need a base for all conversions.
Something similar to http://dish.allrecipes.com/cup-to-gram-conversions/

Items will either be a quantity based (ie 3eggs) or a 
measurement based (ie 2cups flour == 128grams * 2 == 256g flour)

With this, we hope to help manage pantries, store recipes, make cooking fun, fast, efficent and less
stressful. Save money and share recpies and have fun in the process.

Cheers.
